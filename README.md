## Installing ##
### Preresquites ###
Before installing the project, you will need the following. Some have been marked as optional, in which case, they are optional and not required, but recommended.

* Internet connection
* Node.js v16.11.1 or higher
* NPM v8.0.0 or higher
* MySQL v8.0.28
* Git CLI

**Important!** The `git` commands used are adapted for git version 2.32.0 (Apple Git-132). This may vary across platforms or new versions.

### Installation ###
To install the bot's code, please use the following commands.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Coder-Tavi/Mochi`
2. `cd Mochi`
3. `npm install`

Once done, you need to create a `config.json` file. A template is provided below as to show what the bot is expecting
```json
{
  "bot": {
    "applicationId": "",
    "guildId": "",
    "token": ""
  },
  "discord": {
    "devRole": "",
    "devChannel": "",
    "logChannel": "",
    "suppressChannel": ""
  },
  "mysql": {
    "host": "",
    "user": "",
    "password": "",
    "database": ""
  }
}
```

When you are done with that, you can run the bot using the following command:
* `node index.js`

To validate your code against the ESLint configuration, please use the following command:
* `npx eslint ./`

## Commands ##
Since this bot operates on Discord's slash commands, all commands can be viewed by typing `/` into the Discord chat bar. You will see a list of commands appear for the different bots. Scroll until you see the bot's. All available commands will be listed there.
### Settings ###
In this command, you may notice that the command asks you for an option and value. This is due to the fact that creating a subcommand for each option is a little ineffective and wouldn't work out great for the bot and you. Therefore, I have used options instead. Here's what each option does and what the value should be.
